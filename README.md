## Travel Site Demo

This a demo of a travel site built along with Brad Schiff's course on Udemy, [Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow](https://www.udemy.com/git-a-web-developer-job-mastering-the-modern-workflow/) in an effort to learn some best practices and a better workflow.

It is a responsive, mobile-first landing page for a fictional travel company.

This implementation uses vanilla Javascript rather than jQuery as used in the course.
